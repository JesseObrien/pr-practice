# pr-practice
A place for anyone to practice submitting GitHub Pull Requests.

Often when you submit a pull request to a project, a maintainer might ask you to change something about it before they will merge it.

In order for people to have a place to practice *just* the process of changing a pull request to see what it's like without distraction or fear, I've created this repo! Here's how this works:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Change something about it. Anything. Add files! Change files!
3. Submit a pull request to this repo.
4. Within a few days, I **will** ask you to change something about your pull request (and help you with how to do it if you would like). It will be something along the lines of:
  - Changing a commit message
  - Changing the actual change
  - Adding something else
  - Removing part of your change
  - Squashing two commits into one
  - Rebasing on the current master branch
5. Make the change requested. Ask for help if you need it!
6. Within a few days of you successfully making the change, I **will** merge your pull request and congratulate you with emoji :)
